                <p>We've been in the Fluid Handling Equipment industry for over 40 years and we’ve seen and contributed a lot to the evolution of pumps for a wide range of applications. So when our customers complained about melted marine AC coolant pumps and the problems they caused, we came up with a solution.</p>
                <p>We knew the solution was ‘run dry protection’ so we designed a marine AC coolant pump that could withstand thermal overload in the absence of a liquid flow. With a few design changes, some upgrades in materials, and testing, we created the KoolAir HVAC Cooling Pump.</p>
                <p>A KoolAir Pump is a marine HVAC coolant pump that does not get damaged when overheated in the absence of a liquid flow. Most notably, when strainers become clogged, the KoolAir Pump will run for several hours before shutting down. When it cools down, it resumes operations as normal.</p>
