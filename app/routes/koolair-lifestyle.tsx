            <p>Koolair Lifestyle - A clogged strainer on your boat can spell the end of a perfect day if you're left with a melted coolant pump and no air conditioner.</p>
            <p>Koolair Lifestyle. A clogged strainer on your boat can spell the end of a perfect day if you’re left with a melted coolant pump. KoolAir Pump is less expensive than a comparable marine a/c coolant pump. Mind you, those pumps are without ‘dry run protection’. The performance and quality is equal. Likewise parts are even interchangeable. Only KoolAir provides the exclusive added value of 'run dry protection' and the peace of mind it delivers. Why settle? You do not have to and also, you shouldn't.</p>
            <p>Our engineers designed KoolAir specifically to withstand the higher temperatures reached when liquid is not flowing, and, in fact, the KoolAir pump will run several hours before shutting itself down without damage. After reintroducing water, you simply wait for the pump to cool on its own (or hose it down) and it will resume operating normally.</p>
            <p>And so can you.</p>
