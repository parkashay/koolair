               <p><span>In the tariff for UPS and other small package carriers, once a package requires additional handling (70 lbs) the service time in transit is not guaranteed because it requires additional personnel. It is any service from ground to air, usually you do not see the delays with ground because there is more time/people that move the packages. With NDA and other air services there are more often delays due to capacity issues and if the center is behind they do not have the extra hands. That is standard for all small package carriers; what some customers do is split a shipment into 2 packages to ensure they arrive on time if together one package would be over 70 lbs or they ship out one extra day early. Furthermore, we are not responsible for delays in shipping due to ongoing supply chain disruptions from the Covid-19 pandemic.</span></p>
